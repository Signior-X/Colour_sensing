# Colour_sensing
Minor Project
In this project, I have made a system which can detect/sense the color of the LED using microcontroller(esp8266) and LDR Sensor.

Using the difference in the intensities of different colors of light, we get different values of resistance in the photoresistor,
which in turn change the voltage difference in the potentiometer circuit.

Then according to the values, the microcontroller tells wheather the color is red, green or blue.
